### Nimbatus - The Save File Constructor

    Hello fellow nimbatussers? Is that how you all are called? Nah I'm joking.
    Thank you for being a cheater like me :^). No serious!, you rock!.
    I will not go in to much detail about my self but I just like constructing 
    for hours. I noticed I got a little bit bored because of the slow progress
    I made myself that I decided I would like to cheat. Just becaue all those
    weapon upgrades...   (╯°□°）╯︵ ┻━┻

    ....

    Anyway,.. ┬─┬ ノ( ゜-゜ノ)... My background is a backend python developer.
    Recently I learned that C# also have its own garbage collecter. Technical
    stuff!@? Stop it!... Long story short. This is my first c# project.
    From python application which was unable to compress the save file to fully
    working c# application.

    ----

    Just open up your save and enjoy!

### How does it works

**`Works with new saves and with older saves`**

1. Open `Nimbatus.exe (The save constructor)`
2. Click the `Open` and navigate to your save file:
\
    The save file is normally located in the appdata folder of your system \
    `C:\Users\<YOURUSERNAME>\AppData\LocalLow\Nimbatus\Nimbatus\Saves`

    ```
    If you want the save file on the top row of the game, you simply select
    "Slot1.nSave". If you want the second save in the in game you select 
    "Slot2.nSave". I dont think I need to explain further...
    ```
3. Edit the data you would like to edit
4. Click the save button
5. Start your game and enjoy!

### Trouble shooting

1. If you experience any issues please remove the tmp folder from \
    `c:\Nimbatus - The Save Constructor\tmp`
2. Try to edit your save file again
3. Contact me on discord through the official Nimbatus discord server. \
    Issues can be post in the `modding_nimbatus` channel. You can ping me \
    with the following tag `<@275280442884751360>`.

Note: I am not a game developer or have worked on the game or am affiliated with the game 
Note: The supported version which this program is tested on is always
      the "Nimbatus version" which you can find after starting the application.
Note: TSC stands for The Save Constructor
