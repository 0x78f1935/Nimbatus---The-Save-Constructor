### Nimbatus - The Save File Constructor

	Hello Nimbatussers! jk. Its been a while.
	Last version released was with game version 0.6 and we are almost out of beta!
	Therefor i Thought it would be a good idea to release a new version where the new
	currency is supported.
	
	The new version also checks for new updates. I would like to take the time and 
	reverse engineer the game, however i need to get into it again. This costs time.
	In order to still let you enjoy your cheats I have added a feature to check for updates.
	
### How does it works

**`Works with new saves and with older saves`**

1. Open `Nimbatus.exe (The save constructor)`
2. Click the `Open` and navigate to your save file:
\
    The save file is normally located in the appdata folder of your system \
    `C:\Users\<YOURUSERNAME>\AppData\LocalLow\Nimbatus\Nimbatus\Saves\SaveFiles`

    ```
    If you want the save file on the top row of the game, you simply select
    "Slot1.nimbSave". If you want the second save in the in game you select 
    "Slot2.nimbSave". I dont think I need to explain further...
    ```
3. Edit the data you would like to edit
4. Click the save button
5. Start your game and enjoy!

### Trouble shooting

1. If you experience any issues please remove the tmp folder from \
    `c:\Nimbatus - The Save Constructor\tmp`
    
2. Make sure .NET Framework 4.7 is installed, This is made by microsoft. \
    You can do this in 2 different ways. Make sure you are running windows 10 \
    and update your pc.
    
    Or install it manual from the official microsoft website \
    `https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=56116`
    
3. Try to edit your save file again
